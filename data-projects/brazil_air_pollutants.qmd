## Introduction

Air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide, are critical indicators in public health studies due to their impacts on human health. These pollutants originate from various sources such as vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and biomass burning. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to a range of health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, adverse birth outcomes, and increased mortality rates. In public health research, air pollutants are used to assess environmental exposure, identify at-risk populations, and quantify the burden of disease attributable to poor air quality.

I created some datasets on air pollutants for Brazilian municipalities using a zonal statistics procedure with data available from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global reanalysis (EAC4).

## Particulate Matter

Particulate Matter is a widely used indicator in public health studies due to its association with adverse health outcomes. These fine particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, reaching the alveoli and the bloodstream, leading to increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, premature mortality, and other chronic health conditions. In epidemiological research, PM levels are often used to assess population exposure to air pollution and to estimate the burden of disease attributable to environmental factors.

The PM data indicators were downloaded from the Copernicus' Atmosphere Data Store and processed to provide three daily indicators for the Brazilian municipalities:

-   Minimum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly minimum values of PM of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's minimum daily indicator.
-   Maximum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly maximum values of PM of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's maximum daily indicator.
-   Average values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly average values of PM of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's average daily indicator.

Those indicators are presented in Parquet and CSV formats. The computational codes used to create those datasets are openly available [here](https://github.com/rfsaldanha/camsdata).

The datasets are available to download here:

## CO

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas produced mainly by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, and it represents a serious threat to public health. Short-term exposure to high concentrations can cause dizziness, headaches, impaired vision, confusion, and, in severe cases, death, while chronic low-level exposure has been associated with cardiovascular and neurological problems. Monitoring CO levels in the environment and enforcing air quality standards are therefore essential measures for preventing both acute poisoning incidents and longer-term health burdens in urban populations.

The CO data indicators were downloaded from the Copernicus' Atmosphere Data Store and processed to provide three daily indicators for the Brazilian municipalities:

-   Minimum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly minimum values of CO of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's minimum daily indicator.
-   Maximum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly maximum values of CO of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's maximum daily indicator.
-   Average values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly average values of CO of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's average daily indicator.

Those indicators are presented in Parquet and CSV formats. The computational codes used to create those datasets are openly available [here](https://github.com/rfsaldanha/camsdata).

## NO2 

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a harmful air pollutant primarily generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, especially from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities. Its is related to respiratory problems, as exposure can irritate the airways, reduce lung function, and increase the risk of asthma, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory diseases. Children, the elderly, and individuals with preexisting health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Long-term exposure has also been linked to cardiovascular problems and premature mortality.

The NO2 data indicators were downloaded from the Copernicus' Atmosphere Data Store and processed to provide three daily indicators for the Brazilian municipalities:

-   Minimum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly minimum values of NO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's minimum daily indicator.
-   Maximum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly maximum values of NO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's maximum daily indicator.
-   Average values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly average values of NO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's average daily indicator.

Those indicators are presented in Parquet and CSV formats. The computational codes used to create those datasets are openly available [here](https://github.com/rfsaldanha/camsdata).

## O3

Ozone (O3) at ground level is a major component of smog and an air pollutant. Unlike stratospheric ozone, which protects life from harmful ultraviolet radiation, tropospheric ozone is a harmful pollutant with significant public health implications. Short-term exposure can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, aggravate asthma, and reduce lung function, especially during outdoor physical activity. Prolonged exposure is associated with chronic respiratory diseases, increased hospital admissions, and premature mortality due to cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. Children, older adults, and individuals with preexisting health problems are most at risk.

The O3 data indicators were downloaded from the Copernicus' Atmosphere Data Store and processed to provide three daily indicators for the Brazilian municipalities:

-   Minimum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly minimum values of O3 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's minimum daily indicator.
-   Maximum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly maximum values of O3 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's maximum daily indicator.
-   Average values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly average values of O3 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's average daily indicator.

Those indicators are presented in Parquet and CSV formats. The computational codes used to create those datasets are openly available [here](https://github.com/rfsaldanha/camsdata).

## SO2

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a toxic gas mainly produced by the burning of fossil fuels containing sulfur, such as coal and oil, as well as by industrial processes like metal smelting and oil refining. SO2 concentrations irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing, throat irritation, and shortness of breath even at relatively low concentrations. People with asthma, children, and the elderly are particularly sensitive, as exposure can trigger asthma attacks and worsen existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Long-term exposure contributes to chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function, and increased risk of premature death. 

The SO2 data indicators were downloaded from the Copernicus' Atmosphere Data Store and processed to provide three daily indicators for the Brazilian municipalities:

-   Minimum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly minimum values of SO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's minimum daily indicator.
-   Maximum values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly maximum values of SO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's maximum daily indicator.
-   Average values: for each municipality boundary and day, the hourly average values of SO2 of all intersecting cells are averaged, resulting in the municipality's average daily indicator.

Those indicators are presented in Parquet and CSV formats. The computational codes used to create those datasets are openly available [here](https://github.com/rfsaldanha/camsdata).
