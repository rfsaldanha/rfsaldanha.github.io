## Introduction

Climate indicators are used on several statistical models for many research areas and are specially important for modeling Climate Sensitive Diseases (CSD) incidence. Those models usually adopts a lattice structure, where its data is aggregated at administrative boundaries (e.g. disease incidence), but climate indicators are usually presented in a continuous regular grid format.

To make climate indicators compatible with lattice structures, zonal statistics may be adopted. Zonal statistics are descriptive statistics calculated using a set of cells that spatially intersects a given spatial boundary. For each boundary in a map, statistics like average, maximum value, minimum value, standard deviation, and sum are obtained to represent the cell's values that intersect the boundary.

I created some zonal statistics of climate indicators datasets for Brazilian municipalities from some climate data products.

## Zonal ERA5-Land

The ERA5-Land data [@muñoz-sabater2021] presents hourly climate indicators at 0.1° × 0.1° horizontal resolution with global coverage, from 1950 to present.

Selected indicators hourly data were [downloaded and aggregated at daily basis](http://localhost:6732/data-projects/era5land-daily-latin-america.html) to compute zonal statistics for the Brazilian municipalities.

The following indicators and aggregations were computed.

| ERA5-Land indicators | Daily time-aggregating functions | Spatial zonal statistics |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Temperature (2m) | mean, max, min | max, min, stdev, count |
| Dewpoint temp. (2m) | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| $u$ component of wind | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| $v$ component of wind | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| Surface pressure | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| Total precipitation | sum | max, min, stdev, count, sum |

A paper with the full methodology was published in the Environmental Data Science journal.

### Usage statistics

Usage statistics of this and other datasets are available [here](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/pkgdash/#datasets).

## Zonal BR-DWGD

1961-01-01 to 2024-03-20: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-10.5281/zenodo.13906834-green.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13906834)

The BR-DWGD dataset [@xavier2022] presents daily meteorological data interpolated to a grid with 0.1° × 0.1° of spatial resolution for the Brazilian territory, with daily data starting on January 1, 1961. It uses data from several weather stations rain gauges in its interpolation methods, cross-validated to the selection of the best method for each weather indicator.

The following weather indicators are available from the BR-DWGD study: precipitation (mm), minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), solar radiation (MJ⋅m−2 ), wind speed at 2m height (m⋅s−1) and relative humidity (%).

The following zonal statistics were computed.

| BR-DGWD indicators | Daily time-aggregating functions | Spatial zonal statistics |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Temperature | max, min | max, min, stdev, count |
| Relative humidity | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| $u$ component of wind | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| Evapotranspiration | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| Solar radiation | mean | max, min, stdev, count |
| Precipitation | sum | max, min, stdev, count, sum |

## Zonal TerraClimate

The TerraClimate [@abatzoglou2018] dataset presents monthly meteorological data interpolated to a grid with 0.04° × 0.04° (1/24th degree) of spatial resolution with world cover, with monthly data from January, 1958, to December, 2021.

The following weather indicators are available from the TerraClimate study: Actual Evapotranspiration (mm), Climate Water Deficit (mm), Potential evapotranspiration(mm), Precipitation (mm), Runoff (mm), Soil Moisture (mm), Downward surface shortwave radiation (W/m2), Snow water equivalent (mm), Minimum temperature (°C), Maximum temperature (°C), Vapor pressure (kPa), Wind speed (m/s), Vapor Pressure Deficit (kpa) and Palmer Drought Severity Index.

The following zonal statistics were computed.

brclimr::product_info(product = "terraclimate")
```

The results are availabe as parquet files, available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7825777) and can be also accessed with the [brclimr](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/brclimr) R package.
