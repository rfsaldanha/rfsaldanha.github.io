## Introduction

INMET is the Brazilian official source of meteorological forecasts. It also maintains the [ALERT-AS](https://alertas2.inmet.gov.br/), an weather alert center for the Brazilian territory. 

The alerts are broadcasted in the RSS format and there is no official record history of alerts available. Thus, I started to run a daily script to record those alerts and made them available to the public. The record started on September 29, 2025 at 4pm.

## Data

The alerts are fetched daily at 1am using the [inmetrss](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/inmetrss/) R package. After fetching new alerts and updating the database, a parquet file is exported to an S3 storage, available at the link bellow:

```
https://inmetalerts.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inmetalerts.parquet
```

## Data usage

The parquet data present the alerts in the original structure from INMET. The package [inmetrss](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/inmetrss/) presents a function to parse the alerts by municipality.

```{r}
#| messages: false
suppressMessages({
  library(arrow)
  library(DT)
  library(inmetrss)
})

res <- read_parquet(
  "https://inmetalerts.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inmetalerts.parquet"
)

res_mun <- parse_mun(head(res, 10))

datatable(res_mun)
```

## Session info

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
